I guess that, like me, many others will be glad to leave 2020 behind, and like me, many of you will have a (long) list of new year
ressolutions. Well, let me talk a bit about something that I've seen across the board: people wanting to learn to program in a particular
language: Rust, Go, Typescript... clojure? :)

Starting is easy. You get a book, a couple of online tutorials... you feel it, this is the year you will finally master X!

Now, do this now and thank me later: set yourself a reminder in 3 to 6 weeks to "Let's learn X... for real!"

Why do we struggle to learn a new language? well, because we don't use it everyday, because we do not have the routines to allow us to carry
on... or because we don't know very well how to learn.

Learning to program in a new language is much more than learning the sintax and setting up an IDE, however, without direction, we will get
lost sooner than later. One of the best ways of keeping the right direction is using a platform like [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) where
you will find not only exercises to practice, but also mentors that will guide you through the darkest nights of obscure bugs.

Lack of direction or objectives is the reason number one for people not to endure the learning process. I will not lie, learning a new
language is hard for two reasons: because you feel your productivity suffers and because you don't have "the need" to do something useful.
Exercism will help you with the first one, finding the right personal project will help you with the second one.

I strongly advise to think about what to build. Don't be lazy, don't say something like "An API to blah blah" define the use case, the tests
even, define, define, define. Do you need a tool to extract all the links from all your slack channels and add then to a google spreadsheet?
go ahead, define, define, define! Whatever it is, be precise in what your objective is. Write it down, and go for it.

What if you don't have any ideas? well, don't panic, you still have some time to decide. The first weeks is more about learning syntax and
getting the feeling for it than anything else, so, do not panic! What if by the time that you have mastered the syntax you still don't have
any ideas worth building? well, in my experience that's rare, but if this happens, ask one of your friends. I'm sure that someone in your
inner circle needs help with something.

Remember, learning is hard, so, be aware of it. Construct a routine that allows you to practice. Plan and define things ahead of "crunch
time", this is another tip I give to my engineers: find time to practice and find time to define. The more you do the later, the better
results you will get in the former.

Learning is hard, but very rewarding. Good luck!
